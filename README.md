# Readme

Hey! Welcome to my solution for the first Buda challenge :D implemented in Ruby

## Overview

The objective of this challenge is to do a Proof of Work. In partcular, find a string whose sha256 is equal to _target_ equal to **b00da**

## Execution

On a terminal, run: `make`.

In my solution, **b00da** is the _target_. To change the **target**, edit in the `Makefile` the variable `TARGET`
